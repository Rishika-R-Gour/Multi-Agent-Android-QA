## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent System Design
```python
# Agent-S Framework Integration
planner = PlannerAgent()
strategy = planner.generate_test_plan("wifi_automation")

executor = ExecutorAgent(device="pixel_6_emulator") 
executor.execute_strategy(strategy)  # ADB + UI automation

verifier = VerifierAgent()
results = verifier.validate_screenshots(expected_ui_states)

supervisor = SupervisorAgent()
report = supervisor.compile_results(strategy, results)
```
